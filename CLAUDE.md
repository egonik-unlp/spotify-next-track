# Spotify Next-Track (session recommendation)

A next track-prediction lab: a Qdrant corpus of embedded
tracks feeds dataset builds (PCA + metadata features),
language-neutral predictor plugins train on them, and lensing-server orchestrates
runs, promoted models and predictions behind a React UI.

## Where domain truth lives

- **`domain.toml` is the single source of domain truth** — corpus schema,
  target variable, feature fields, quality-rule bindings, metrics, UI
  vocabulary, and the agentic-layer parameters. Bootstrapping this template
  into a new problem = editing that file (see BOOTSTRAP.md).
- The files under `.claude/`, `.agents/` and `.gemini/` (skills + agents,
  except `impeccable`) are **GENERATED** from `agents-src/` — edit the
  template and run `zig build render-agents`; never hand-edit the outputs.
  `zig build check` fails on drift.
- Volatile empirical knowledge (leaderboard, noise bands, per-family
  pitfalls, dataset lineage) lives in `experiments/PROJECT-FACTS.md` — agents read it
  first and reconcile it after every campaign. The `experiments/*.md`
  campaign reports are primary; the newest report wins.

## State & persistence

- **Postgres** (docker compose; `zig build db-up`) is the metadata store:
  model definitions (authoritative; `models.toml` is the git-diffable
  export), runs + metrics, promoted-model records, the best-models group,
  dataset index, run events. `zig build migrate-data` backfills it from the
  files and prints a consistency report — it never modifies the files.
- The **best-models group** (top-12 by recall@10)
  is server-maintained: recomputed on every run completion and model
  promotion/deletion, auto-promoting top runs. Served at
  `GET /api/best-models`; consensus predictions at
  `POST /api/best-models/predict`; curation (pin/exclude) via
  `PUT /api/best-models`. Mirror: `data/best-models.json` + the
  `best_models` table.
- **`data/`** holds the binary artifacts (datasets, run dirs, model
  snapshots). NEVER write under `data/` by hand.
- The Qdrant corpus (`spotify_tracks` at `http://localhost:6337`) is hosted by
  this instance's own compose stack (`zig build db-up` starts it via the
  `qdrant` profile); manual entries live in `manual-tracks`.
- **Refreshing / injecting newer corpus data** — the corpus-build pipeline is
  vendored in-repo under `pipeline/corpus/` (ingest → enrich → clean →
  sessionize → aggregates → embed → transitions → ids → upsert); the instance is
  self-contained, no external checkout needed. To inject a newer Spotify account
  export: replace the *Extended streaming history* export under `extended-2026/`
  (both `endsong_*.json` and the newer `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json` shapes
  are accepted), then run **`pipeline/refresh_corpus.sh`** — it rebuilds
  `spotify_tracks`, runs the AE chain (→ `spotify_tracks_content`,
  `spotify_tracks_song_ae`), and POSTs the canonical Song-AE dataset recipe
  (`pipeline/corpus/dataset_recipe.json`). `enrich` fetches only new
  tracks/artists and needs Spotify Web API credentials in `.env`
  (client-credentials flow). The corpus build runs in `pipeline/corpus/.venv`
  (Python 3.12 — gensim; one-time `pipeline/corpus/setup_venv.sh`), kept separate
  from `predictors/.venv` (3.14). The binary `rotation` target (`play_count >=
  2`) is materialized by `aggregates` and rides the AE chain via payload copy.
  After a refresh, datasets and models are stale — rebuild + retrain.

## Non-negotiables

- The server (`http://localhost:8096`) must already be running for skills/agents;
  **never restart lensing-server** without checking `GET /api/runs` for live
  training runs first — they die on restart.
- Never hand-edit `models.toml` while the server runs (it is rewritten on
  every mutation).
- Talk to the system through the API, not the filesystem.

## Build entry points

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `zig build serve` | build backend + UI, start Postgres, run lensing-server (also spawns the playlist-pathfinder sidecar) |
| `zig build pathfinder-setup` | one-time `pathfinder/.venv` for the playlist-pathfinder sidecar (qdrant-client + numpy + requests) |
| `zig build db-up` / `db-down` | start/stop the compose services (pgdata volume survives) |
| `zig build migrate-data` | idempotent file→Postgres backfill + consistency report |
| `zig build dataset` | build a dataset with default flags |
| `zig build render-agents` | render `.claude/.agents/.gemini` from `agents-src/` + `domain.toml` |
| `zig build check` | tests + lint + py-check + agent-template drift |
| `zig build worker` / `infer` | distributed training / inference roles (docs/DEPLOY.md) |
| `zig build package` | distributable template under `dist/` |

## Skills & agents

- **dataset-design** — preflight quality filters, analyze spectra, build and
  inspect datasets inline; delegates bigger jobs to the dataset-architect
  agent.
- **dataset-architect** (agent) — designs datasets (lineage-mined,
  preflighted, EVR-justified proposals) and builds them on approval; spawned
  via the dataset-design skill or by experiment-designer for dataset-level
  experimental needs.
- **model-definitions** — define/clone/tag/launch model definitions; the
  experiment workflow (design → launch → collect → report → reconcile
  `experiments/PROJECT-FACTS.md`).
- **experiment-designer** (agent) — designs the next experiment with you:
  mines the record, proposes a self-contained design (consulting the
  dataset-architect for dataset-level axes); iterate via SendMessage.
  Design-only — it never launches.
- **experiment-runner** (agent) — executes a user-approved design verbatim:
  launches, babysits, collects, reports, reconciles the facts file. Refuses
  incomplete designs.
- **best-model-selector** (agent) — curates the best-models group with the
  judgment the deterministic recompute can't apply (family diversity,
  suspicious-metric exclusion, pinning); spawn after a campaign concludes or
  new models are registered.
- **report-curator** — maintains four lockstep docs from the campaign reports
  (+ shared figures): docs/experiments.{tex,es.tex} (English + Spanish, whole
  series) and docs/next-track.{tex,es.tex} (English + Spanish, next-track
  family only); destructive edits stop for approval.
- **listing-generator** (agent) — URL → manual track → consensus
  predictions via `POST /api/best-models/predict`.
- **upstream-sync** (agent) — sync upstream lensing framework changes into
  this instance, stepwise with approval gates: 3-way classification against
  the `.lensing-upstream.json` provenance manifest (diff-driven when
  absent), gated batches (build/tooling → rust → predictors → ui →
  agents-src + re-render → docs) as one git commit each; never touches
  domain.toml / models.toml / data/ / registry.toml and never restarts the
  server.
